The RDH retrieved raw 2020 general election results from Election results come from the [Alabama Secretary of State](https://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data) and precinct shapefiles from VEST's Alabama 2020 file.

## Notes on Field Names (adapted from VEST):
Columns reporting votes generally follow the pattern: 
The first character is G for a general election, P for a primary, S for a special, and R for a runoff.
Characters 2 and 3 are the year of the election.
Characters 4-6 represent the office type (see list below).
Character 7 represents the party of the candidate.
Characters 8-10 are the first three letters of the candidate's last name.
One example is:
G16PREDCLI

To fit within the GIS 10 character limit for field names, the naming convention is slightly different for the State Legislature and US House of Representatives. All fields are listed below with definitions.

PRE - President of the United States
USS - U.S. Senate
CON## - U.S. House, accompanied by a CONG_DIST column indicating district number

## Processing Steps
    
The RDH joined additional election results to VEST's existing precinct shapefile, including U.S. House using Python.
For more information on the processing completed, visit our Github repository(https://github.com/nonpartisan-redistricting-datahub/erj-al) for Election Result Joins (ERJ) for Alabama.
Where possible, the RDH validated the election results we processed against VEST's election results. For additional races the RDH manually checked state totals. For more information on this comparison, please see our processing on Github (https://github.com/nonpartisan-redistricting-datahub/erj-al).

## Additional Notes
Election Results matched State Wide totals.
