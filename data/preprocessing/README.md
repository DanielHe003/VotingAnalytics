For California:
For the Data I got the cenus block demographic data and the precinct voting data
and combined them together.

As for the data what type of data do you guys need. Should I turn some of the return values to percents.
As a side note, for the final combined precint, there seems to be data that is lost when combining the
shape files together. For now I will just fill those value with zero.
